Overview
GenaiPioneerCVLevel1 is a computer vision project developed using Google Colab, focusing on foundational generative AI techniques applied to image data. This repository contains code, notebooks, and resources aimed at beginners exploring generative AI within computer vision.

Features
Developed and tested entirely on Google Colab
Implements core computer vision tasks using generative AI
Includes step-by-step explanations and runnable Colab notebooks
Easy to follow for beginners and intermediate learners

Getting Started
Accessing the Colab Notebook
The primary interface for this project is a Google Colab notebook. You can open and run the notebook directly in your browser:

GenaiPioneerCVLevel1.ipynb on colab
Cloning the Repository
If you want to clone the repository locally or on another environment:

git clone https://github.com/sajidz15/GenaiPioneerCVLevel1.git
cd GenaiPioneerCVLevel1
Running Locally
The project is designed to run smoothly on Colab, but you can run the code locally if you have the necessary dependencies installed. Make sure you have Python 3.x and required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Then run the main scripts or Jupyter notebooks as needed.

Usage
Open the Colab notebook linked above

Follow the instructions in the notebook cells to run code step-by-step

Modify inputs or parameters to experiment with different computer vision tasks
